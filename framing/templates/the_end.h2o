            Hi,<br/>
            <br/>
            As you may or may not have heard, Boothi.ca will be switching to read-only some time around the 30th of January.
            This means that there is a little less than 1 week left before the site goes quiet.<br/>
            <br/>
            I thought I'd take this opportunity to thank everyone who made Boothi.ca what it was.  I consider Boothi.ca a
            success, despite my decision to close it's doors and move on.<br/>
            <br/>
            If you'd like to make one last splash before January 30th, head over to the site and get in one or two final booths.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <div style="width: 100%; text-align: center">
                <a style = "color: white; text-decoration: none;" href="{{ baseUrl }}">Click here to go to Boothi.ca</a>
            </div>
            <br/>
            Stay tuned to <a style = "color: white; text-decoration: none;" href="http://twitter.com/boothicanews">Our Twitter Account</a> because I'll be posting information
            about how you can download all of your booths, should you want to do so.<br/>
            <br/>
            See you around,<br/>
